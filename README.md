## Find the largest of three numbers

Using if statements you need to find the largest number between
three numbers.

##### Your Task ðŸ˜ƒ:
1. Create 3 variables and in each variable give it a number of your choice
2. Create an if statement that determines which of the three numbers is the largest and console log this sentence*'The largest number out of the three numbers is X'*

Good Luck ðŸ˜€

Solution:

const num = 10
const num = 20
const num = 30

if(!num>=10){
    console.log( "Smallest Number")
} else if(!num ==20){
    console.log(" Medium Number")
} else{
    console.log("The largest number out of the three numbers is 30")
}
